# Processing Big Data

In this repository, the project developed in the [Processing Big Data](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/meec21/disciplina-curricular/1127428915200266) academic course will be made available. The goal of the project is to segment a video of cycling races by “type of shot”, which is indexed by the pose of the cyclists and the contents of the image. 

The project structure follows the data processing “pipeline” : Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Representation, Visualization, Modeling, Algorithm Design and Performance analysis. Furthermore, the project will show the reality of “big data processing”: lack of a clear problem structure, heterogeneity of the data, huge dimension and unreliable data (outliers).
