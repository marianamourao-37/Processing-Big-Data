# Processing Big Data

In this repository, the project developed in the [Processing Big Data](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/meec21/disciplina-curricular/1127428915200266) academic course will be made available. The goal of the project is to segment a video of cycling races by “type of shot”, which is indexed by the pose of the cyclists and the contents of the image. For a more detailed description of the project, read the [Project statement PDF](https://github.com/marianamourao-37/Processing-Big-Data/blob/main/Project%20Statement.pdf). 

The project follows a data processing "pipeline" that includes Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Representation, Visualization, Modeling, Algorithm Design, and Performance Analysis. Additionally, the project highlights the challenges of processing big data, such as the lack of clear problem structure, data heterogeneity, high dimensionality, and unreliable data (e.g., outliers).
