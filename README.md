# Processing Big Data

In this repository, the project developed in the [Processing Big Data](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/meec21/disciplina-curricular/1127428915200266) academic course will be made available. The goal of the project is to segment a video of cycling races by “type of shot”, which is indexed by the pose of the cyclists and the contents of the image. For a more detailed description of the project, read the [Project statement PDF](https://github.com/marianamourao-37/Processing-Big-Data/blob/main/Project%20Statement.pdf). 

The project structure follows the data processing “pipeline” : Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Representation, Visualization, Modeling, Algorithm Design and Performance analysis. Furthermore, the project will show the reality of “big data processing”: lack of a clear problem structure, heterogeneity of the data, huge dimension and unreliable data (outliers).
